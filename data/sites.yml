    - content: Juicer is a personal project of mine. It came about not because I am passionate about social media feeds (or social media marketing in general) but rather because I saw a space in the market for it, and I was going to have to basically build it anyways.
    - content: Over the course of two years I had three separate clients ask me to put a "social media feed" on to their sites. For those who don't know what that is, it's basically all of their posts from their various business-related social media posts in a single location. Doing this manually would obviously be a huge pain in the ass (you'd have toupdate the website every time you tweet.
    - content: When my first client asked me to do this, I immediately googled <strong><em>Social Media Feed</em></strong>.
    - content: I found a service called <strong>Tint</strong>. Tint was great, it did exactly what I wanted it to do, you'd enter in your social media account names, copy and paste some code on to your site and <em>voila</em> you had a social media feed on your site. Best of all Tint cost $10 a month.
    - content: Tint did all the heavy lifting for you, it connected to the social media sites (which can be a surprising pain in the ass, and each one is different), and automatically pulled in the new posts for you, so once you embedded it you didn't have to do anything after that.
    - content: I happily used Tint for several clients sites until I was building the site for <a href='http://www.descendants.tv' target='_blank'>Descendants</a> and they asked me to add a social media feed. I went to go sign them up to Tint when I discovered that Tint had raised their prices from $10 a month to $250 a month (since then they have raised their prices again to $500 a month).
    - content: <img src='/images/juicer-2.jpg' class='u-pull-left' alt='Juicer Menu' /> Descendants obviously didn't want to pay $250 a month but they still wanted a social media feed on their site. They asked if I would build a custom one for them. I said I would just build a tint-like service and not charge them for it (on the condition they sign up for the service). I called it <a href='http://www.juicer.io'>Juicer</a>.
    - content: It works almost exactly the same way Tint does, you enter your social media account names and copy and paste some code on to your site and Juicer does the rest.
    - content: But if you ask me, it's better than Tint.
    - content: In addition to automatically syncing your social media accounts with your embedded feed, here's why I think Juicer is better than Tint (and all other competitors, for that matter)
      clear: true
    - content: <ul>
                 <li>Cheaper! (there's even a free plan)</li>
                 <li>More Social Media Accounts</li>
                 <li>Prettier! (Juicer is probably the most beautiful thing I've ever designed.)</li>
                 <li>Moderation, Filtering, Analytics</li>
               </ul>
    - content: <img src='/images/juicer-3.jpg' class='u-pull-right' alt='Juicer Feed' /> Juicer is also probably one of the best looking sites I've ever designed. It's built in Ruby on Rails, responsive and all that. I manually pull in the posts from 10 different social media sites using libraries I buily myself. I handle payment processing with Stripe. I also spent a long time on SEO.
    - content: Tint is crazy expensive for what they offer, and I don't think that's okay. There are tons of people out there who would like to have a social media feed on their site but definitely cannot afford $500 a month (hell, you can get a decent apartment in the midwest for that much). Juicer is for them.

    - content: Summerland is a subscription based food delivery service. Essentially you sign up and every week you get a box of vegetables and fruit delivered straight to your door. It's kind of like a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture' target='_blank'>CSA</a> box, but you can personalize it, and you don't have to go pick it up yourself.
    - content: Summerland was an interesting project for many reasons. From the consumer facing side, it's your fairly basic e-commerce website. Add some products to your account, and pay!
    - content: There's some twists on that, from a programming perspective. First of all, customers don't just sign up for a one time delivery, they get a box every week (or two weeks, or monthly, or just once!) The logic involved to make sure that everyone get's their delivery when they are supposed to is much more complex than your average e-commerce site.
    - content: Secondly, every box is different. It's a farm to frontdoor style solution, that means whatever the farms are currently offering as a crop is what comes in your box. So of course there has to be a much more complex inventory system on the backend to handle the weekly variances in product.
    - content: Thirdly, Summerland is local to Los Angeles, and they handle deliveries in house. So the backend also contains a driver routing application that allows Summerland's owners to get the most efficient route for the drivers each day. No two days deliveries are ever the same, and a variable number of drivers are working on a given day, so as you might imagine this was also very difficult to program but it resulted in saving the company a whole lot of time and effort.
    - content: Overall a huge amount of effort went in to building a robust and helpful admin section for Summerland. I couldn't have done it without my friend and UI/UX expert <a href='http://www.yeedor.com' target='_blank'>Doris Yee</a>.
