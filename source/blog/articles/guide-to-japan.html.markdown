At least a few people have asked me about my recommendations for what to do/see/eat in Japan, so I’ve decided to post about it. I just got back from my third trip in two years though, so while I am by no means a Japanese master (and this list is by no means exhaustive) I’ve managed to find a lot of stuff about Japan that I love. It’s probably my favorite place to visit, of all the places I’ve been thus far.

## Where to go

I’m going to assume here that you have ~2 weeks to spend in Japan. I’d recommend spending at least half of your time in Tokyo. While the rest of Japan is also great, Tokyo is special (in the same way that places like Paris, or NYC are special). It’s also the biggest city in the world, so there is no lack of things to do.

In descending order of how much I like them, here are all the places in Japan I would recommend visiting in a 2 week trip:

- Tokyo
- Osaka
- Hiroshima
- Kyoto

If you have more than 2 weeks, I would also recommend:

- Himeji
- Kobe
- Fukuoka
- Kagoshima

If you stay this long though, I would recommend doing some more research on your own as there are lots of places I haven’t gone, and I took a pretty atypical route, off the traditional tourist path.

If you plan on spending at least a week outside of Tokyo I highly recommend getting a JR Rail Pass. It’s pretty cheap, and well worth it, as taking the Shinkansen is one of the most pleasurable travel experiences one can have. It’s both efficient, fast, cheap and fun.

## Tokyo

Tokyo really is a spectacular city. It’s huge, but it’s really easy to find a nice quiet area to relax. It’s a world class city with the best food I’ve ever eaten, and some of the most beautiful parks. The public transportation is unreal, and more extensive than anywhere else I’ve ever been by a long shot. It’s also covered in beautiful modern architecture. It’s not as ancient looking as some european cities, but the aesthetic of the city as a whole is much more to my liking than American cities.

### Where to stay

The JR Yamanote is the most famous train line in Tokyo, it forms a giant loop about 10 miles across, inside the loop is what I would consider “Central Tokyo”. I have found myself especially enjoying staying just west of the Yamanote loop, generally west from Shibuya station. Daikanyama, Naka-Meguro and Shimokitazawa are all my favorite places I’ve stayed in Tokyo, and the thing that is nice is there’s lot of stuff happening, but you can walk a few feet and you are in a quiet residential neighborhood. You can’t go wrong anywhere in Tokyo of course, but this is my favorite. In Shibuya, a little further away from the main train station would be really nice, and convenient too.

### Getting around

The subway is the most obvious way to get around Tokyo, and it really is amazing. There’s SO many trains and lines, stops are everywhere, you’re never more than a 5 minute walk from a station anywhere in central Tokyo. Of course, this extensiveness also comes with a cost: it’s confusing. Not only are different lines owned by different companies (and some by the government) but it can be nigh on impossible to plan a more complex trip. Google Maps is going to be your best friend here.

I much prefer to walk, when I can though. Tokyo has got to be one of the best walking cities in the world. There’s so much to see, and much of Central Tokyo is relatively compact, given how many people live there. You’ll really get a sense for the layout of the city as well.

In addition to google maps, check out an app called Crows Flight. It’s similar to google maps, but instead you just put in a destination and it points you in the right direction, as opposed to giving you specific directions. It’s great when you’ve got a destination in mind, but can take your time getting there. Really allows you to explore.

### What To Eat

#### Ramen

Ramen is my favorite Japanese food and probably my favorite food overall. If all you know of ramen is the cheap instant kind from college, you definitely need to try it again. It’s an incredible noodle soup, often times with the most delicious broth, amazing noodles, amazing pork, and a soft-boiled egg.

I can’t really do it justice, so just try it. There’s a few main different kinds of Ramen: Shio, Shoyu, Miso and Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu is my favorite, it’s the porkiest.

Check out Ramen Adventures, they will send you to some of the best Ramen restaurants. Also try Ippudo. They are a relatively small chain with incredible Tonkotsu Ramen.

#### Sushi

The most famous Japanese dish: raw fish on rice.

For the best sushi of your life, head to Tsukiji fish market bright and early (go at 5 or 6am). It’s a good idea to go one of your first days there, as you’ll probably be all fucked up from jet lag and waking up early anyways. My favorite sushi place there is [Daiwa Sushi](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Daiwa+Sushi/@35.6801963,139.7247508,13.89z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0000000000000000:0x4aef449d287074d5!8m2!3d35.6637033!4d139.7695792?hl=en). For about $35 you’ll eat the best sushi you’ve ever had in your life. Afterwards, wander around the fish market and check everything out.

I also recommend going to a “Kaiten” sushi place (conveyor belt) (also called “Sushi go-around”). Basically the sushi travels around the restaurant on a conveyor belt, and when you see something you want to eat, you take it, and you eat it. When you are finished, the waiter will come and count your plates and give you the bill. Not only is this sushi still better than almost everything you get in the US, but it’s super cheap, and you can eat till you are exactly full.

#### Tonkatsu

Essentially deep fried pork chops. Delicious. Often comes with a big mound of cabbage and miso soup. The Japanese know how to do Pork right. My favorite place is called [Tonkatsu Mai Izumi Aoyama](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tonkatsu+Mai+Izumi+Aoyama/@35.6669813,139.7085245,16z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sMaisen+Tonkatsu!3m4!1s0x60188ca1fd36aaab:0x1bb2131af340c474!8m2!3d35.667982!4d139.71153) in Omotesando. It will probably cost you between $20 and $30 per person, depending  on the quality of pork you get, but it’s well worth it. 

#### Udon

Real fat noodles. Oftentimes when you go to an Udon place, you choose the soup base, then, cafeteria style, go through and put various Tempura (e.g. fried) vegetables and shrimps into your soup. It’s real good and cheap. My favorite place is in Ebisu.

#### Gyoza

Fried pork dumplings. Also super good. You can often get them at Ramen restaurants, but you can find them all over the place. If you end up at a place that has them, order some, you won’t regret it.

#### Yakitori

Generally grilled chicken parts on a stick. Cooked to perfection. You’ve never had chicken this good. Common to find this in Shinjuku, but basically every Izakaya (e.g. bar with food) has them as well. You’ll be able to identify the places that have this as there will be copious amounts of smoke pouring out of the building.

#### Gyudon

Literally means “Beef bowl”. A crappier version can be found in the US at Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. Basically scrappy beef on rice. Really good and really cheap. Essentially Japanese McDonalds.

#### Western Style Food

Hamburg-steak, Korroke (croquettes), spaghetti, Curry. These are basically the Japanese version of western style meals (and Indian Curry). Actually really good, even if they aren’t especially authentic. Definitely worth checking out.

### What to do

Go to the big crossing in Shibuya. Walk around and shop. Visit Yoyogi Park. Check out the Meiji Shrine near there. Walk to Harajuku and check out the crazy fashions. Walk around the back alleys and cool stores of Omotesando. Visit Shinjuku at night and see all the crazy lights. Check out the view from the top of Tokyo Metropolitan Building. Eat some fancy food in Ebisu. Visit the top of the Ebisu Garden Place and get the best view of the city. See the Tokyo Swallows (or one of the other 5 baseball teams) play a game. Walk to Shimokitazawa from Shibuya and check out all the beautiful houses and the relaxing atmosphere. Stop by Village Vanguard in Shibuya. Go to Inokashira Park, quite possibly the most beautiful park I’ve ever seen. Stop by 7-11 on the way there and have a picnic. Go to Akihabara and check out the electronics, gape at maid cafe advertisement girls, play vidogames in a huge arcade. Walk from there to Ueno Park, and from there to Asakusa to check out the giant shrine.


## Kyoto

Kyoto is typically the next stop on people’s itinerary after Tokyo. While I personally don’t like it nearly as much as I like Tokyo, some of the cultural sites are pretty amazing. In fact think the reason I like it less, is while the cultural sites and shrines and whatnot are much better than in Tokyo, the city itself I don’t like nearly as much.

### Where to stay

Part of the reason I probably don’t like Kyoto as much as Tokyo is I haven’t found the best place to stay. That being said, while I have never stayed there, I always find myself heading back to the Philosophers Path. If you can stay near there, it will probably be quiet and beautiful, though maybe a bit out of the way. Either way it’s not super important where you stay, as the main sites are relatively close together, and you can always take the train, or even better, stay at a place with bicycles and ride around town.

### What to do

The two best temples, in my opinion are Fushimi Inari (I guess more of a shrine then a temple) and Kinkaku-ji (The Golden Pavilion). Walk all over Fushimi Inari and up the mountain to see thousands of orange Tori gates. Seriously it’s crazy. Kinkaku is just a beautiful building with an even more beautiful garden. It’s also worth checking out Ryoan-ji, which is the best example of a classic Japanese Zen Garden I’ve ever seen, but that’s basically all there is there. I’d also recommend hiking up Mount Daimonji-Yama from Ginkaku-Ji (the Silver Pavilion). There’s an amazing view of the city at the top and a really beautiful forest.

## Osaka

Osaka is best known for it’s food. It’s definitely worth spending a day or two there and stuffing yourself silly.

### What to eat

The main tourist part of Osaka is near the “Namba” station (and Dotonbori) along and nearby the canals. The two types of food you should check out there are Takoyaki (Octopus balls, just get some on the street as a snack) and Okonomiyaki (which is hard to describe, but kind of like a seafood pancake). My favorite okonomiyaki place is called [Mizuno](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1+Chome-4-15+D%C5%8Dtonbori,+Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D-ku,+%C5%8Csaka-shi,+%C5%8Csaka-fu+542-0071,+Japan/@34.6683671,135.5010606,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e714c2f5aaa7:0xfff102c8e8c9b1d2!8m2!3d34.6683627!4d135.5032546). Additionally, probably the best ramen I’ve ever had can be found in Osaka, at a place called [Men-Life](http://www.friendsinramen.com/2011/12/men-life-taku.html) and if I remember correctly, it was actually around the corner from the location this sites map says. It’s highly worth making sure you find it because goddamn is it incredible.
