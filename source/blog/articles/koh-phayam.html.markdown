You might guess this won't be a terribly long post; you'd be right: there's not a whole lot to do on Koh Phayam.

This is totally okay by me as it's super beautiful and extremely relaxing; much needed after spending the majority of the last 2 months in extremely large urban areas.

My days consist mostly of sleeping, eating a nice breakfast and relaxing outside on the beach: either coding or reading.

It's beautiful every day, I sleep with my windows and doors all open. I'm in a room with a balcony on the beach about 100 feet from the water.

Yesterday I rented a motorbike for 24 hours (cost about 6 bucks) and rode it all over the island to explore (it's about 8km by 5km and the roads are more like glorified sidewalks so there are no cars on the island). It was a blast.

I think the place I'm staying at is totally booked up this coming weekend so I'll either have to move to a different resort or to a different island; but for now I'm not worrying about it. I'm just taking it easy.
