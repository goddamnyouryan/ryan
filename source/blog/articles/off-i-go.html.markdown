I may or may not have told you that I'm going to Asia for 6 months. Well I am. I quit my job as a software engineer and 3 days later I got on a plane. I probably should have written this post like over a month ago when I actually left but I've been pretty lazy so I'm leaving it till now.

Here's what I've done so far:

My friend Maura and I flew from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Then from San Francisco we flew straight to Seoul, South Korea. We spent a week there, then Maura flew back to LA and I flew to Shanghai, China. I spent a week then went to Huangshan Mountain followed by Hangzhou China. From there I went to Beijing and then to Harbin for a day. After I went back to Beijing and flew to Nadiad India for my friends wedding. Then I flew to Delhi and drove to Agra. Yesterday I took the train to Jaipur and I am here now. I've detailed all of these places in the following posts.

What I'll (probably, possibly) do after:

Go to Jodhpur and then back to Delhi. I may stay in Delhi or I may head up to the Himalayas. Then I'll fly to Bangkok and probably spend a month bumming around Thailand. I'd like to visit Myanmar (Burma) and Cambodia, then Vietnam. Afterwards I'll likely go to: Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and then back to the good old U S of A.

When I tell people about this trip I generally get one of two reactions, jealousy or pity. "I wish I could do that!". Or "wait you quit your high paying job so you could see...India?". There is probably a little bit of truth in both but YOLO amirite?
